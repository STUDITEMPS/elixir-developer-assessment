# Young Professionals Email Service

The Jobmensa API (https://randomuser.me/api/?seed=jobmensa&results=25) provides an unordered list of graduates to other services.
We want to import and store those graduates into our new Young Professionals email service.
Sadly our legal team requires us to not send more than 100 initial offers at a day due to the risk of incoming fees.
Those below the age of 25 should receive a "Get your first job!"-Email,
while those 25 or above should receive a "Next step in your career"-Email.
